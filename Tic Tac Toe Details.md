Project Title:        
                     Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++
Overview of the Project:
This project is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, implemented in C++. The game allows two players to take turns marking spots on a 3x3 grid, aiming to place three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Tools Used in This Code Writing:
The project is developed using the C++ programming language, utilizing basic input/output functionalities, control structures, and arrays to manage the game's grid. A simple text-based user interface is provided using the standard C++ console.

Coding Fundamentals Used:
Arrays (for the game board)
Control structures (if-else, switch statements)
Functions (to structure the game logic)
Loops (for continuously running the game until a player wins or the game draws)
User input (for choosing the position on the board)

Key Features of This Code:
Two-player mode (Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O")
Real-time grid updates based on player input
Simple user interface with a text-based board
Clear winner announcement or draw detection
Structured functions for better code organization (board display, player turn, etc.)

Learning Outcomes:
Gained experience in designing a basic game using C++
Learned how to use arrays to represent a game board
Practiced handling user inputs and updating the game state dynamically
Improved knowledge of control structures and function-based design

Conclusion:
This project provided a hands-on opportunity to implement a simple but functional game in C++. It allowed me to strengthen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts while creating an interactive program. The game logic and structure can be expanded for further improvements or additional features.
